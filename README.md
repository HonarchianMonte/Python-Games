Games built using Python or Py.games

I followed along and developed an understanding of Python via the games in this course by freeCodeCamp.org.

# Game 1: PONG
Demo: https://youtu.be/56Z4QSpjaFY

My understanding of object placement and movement has grown tremendously through this project. I loved the logical flow to coding solutions for practical problems. 
For Example: 
- If I want to ball to bounce on the paddle, I have to switch the ball to reverse its coordinate direction upon reaching the x and y coordinates for the paddles.
- I also, learned how the score increase requires a method, followed by calling the method whenever an event occurs, aka the ball passes the opposite sides border.
- Lastly, putting sound into this game was absolutely thrilling for me, it brought the game to life with a single sound.
